# Bricks

***Distributed Performance-portable Stencil Compuitation***

# What is bricks

Bricks is a data layout and code generation framework, enable performance-portable stencil across Intel CPUs, Intel 
Knights Landing, Intel GPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, AMD GPUs. Math kernel code and data manipulation code is shared across these 
platform, while achieving best-in-class performance on all platforms simultaneously. Especially, Brick layout is well 
suited to higher-order(bigger-wider) stencil computations.

**Achieve consistent 1.9x-4.9x speedup across different architectures including Skylake, Intel Knights Landing, and NVidia P100 GPUs**

---

Brick layout is flexible, allows flexible domain shapes and enables fast "ghost cell" data communication with MPI.

**Efficient ghost zone exchange achieves up to 10x faster than state-of-the-art YASK and up to 600x compared to cray-mpich/7.7.10 MPI_Types.**
